description: What are Sanabel Al Firdaws ?

---

In the name of Allah the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,  I greet you with the same greeting of Mosses Muhammad and Aisa peace be upon them, Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.  
  
Why did I make such project ? its for the lack of Simple ,Easy to use, Completely free, way to learn about Islam.  

This issue isn't just for English speakers but also for Arabic speakers ...You can feel lost not knowing where to go if you want to find a peice of information about prayer, fasting  , Or just wondering about is something halal or not
